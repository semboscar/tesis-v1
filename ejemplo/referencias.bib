	abstract =	{This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called &quot;Scheduling Function Zero&quot; (SF0). SF0 dynamically adapts the number of reserved cells between neighbor nodes, based on the currently allocated bandwidth and the neighbour nodes&#39; requirements. Neighbor nodes negotiate in a distributed neighbor-to-neighbor basis the cell(s) to be added/deleted. SF0 uses the 6P signaling messages to add/delete cells in the schedule. Some basic rules for deciding when to add/ delete cells and for selecting the cells to be added/deleted within the schedule are also provided.},
